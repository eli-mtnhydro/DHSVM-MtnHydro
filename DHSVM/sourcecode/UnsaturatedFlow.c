Function name: UnsaturatedFlow()

Purpose      : Calculate the unsaturated flow in the soil column, and
adjust the moisture in each soil layer

Sources:
Bras, R. A., Hydrology, an introduction to hydrologic science, Addisson
Wesley, Inc., Reading, etc., 1990.
Wigmosta, M. S., L. W. Vail, and D. P. Lettenmaier, A distributed
hydrology-vegetation model for complex terrain, Water Resour. Res.,
30(6), 1665-1679, 1994.

This function is based on Wigmosta et al [1994], and assumes a unit
hydraulic gradient in the unsaturated zone.  This implies a
steady-state situation and uniform moisture distribution.  This is not
unreasonable for situations where the groundwater is fairly deep
[Bras, 1990], but may be unrealistic for the boreal forest system, or
other similar situations where the groundwater table is relatively close
to the surface. The current formulation does not allow for upward
movement of water in the unsaturated zone, by capillary and matrix
forces.  No unsaturated flux is assumed to occur if the water content
drops below the field capacity.

The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated using the
Brooks-Corey equation see for example Wigmosta et al. [1994], eq.41

The calculated amount of drainage is averaged with the amount calculated
for the previous timestep, see eq. 42 [Wigmosta et al., 1994].

The residual moisture content is assumed to be zero (easy to adapt if
needed).

If the amount of soil moisture in a layer after drainage still
exceeds the porosity for that layer, this additional amount of water is
added to the drainage to the next layer.

CHANGES:

Changes have been made to account for the potental loss of soil storage
in a grid cell due to a channel.  Correction coefficents are
calculated in AdjustStorage() and CutBankGeometry()

Eli Boardman added unsaturated lateral gravimetric interflow (2026)
